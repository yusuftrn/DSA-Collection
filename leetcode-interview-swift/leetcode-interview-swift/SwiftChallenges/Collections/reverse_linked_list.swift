/*
 Challenge 51: Reversing linked lists

 Difficulty: Tricky
 Expand your code from challenge 43 so that it has a reversed() method that returns a copy of itself in reverse.
 Tip: Don’t cheat! It is not a solution to this problem just to reverse the alphabet letters before you create your linked list. Create the linked list alphabetically, then write code to reverse it.
 Sample input and output
 • When you call reversed() on your alphabet list, running printNodes() on the return value should print the English alphabet printed to the screen in reverse,
 i.e. “z y x … d b c a”.
