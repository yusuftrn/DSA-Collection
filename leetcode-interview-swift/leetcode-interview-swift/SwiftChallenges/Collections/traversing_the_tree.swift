 Challenge 45: Traversing the tree
 Difficulty: Easy
 Note: this challenge cannot be attempted until you have first completed challenge 54.
 Write a new method for your binary search tree that traverses the tree in order, running a closure on each node.
 
 Tip: Traversing a node in order means visiting its left value, then visiting its own value, then visiting its right value.
